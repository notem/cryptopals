My work-in-progress solution set to [the cryptopals crypto challenges](https://www.cryptopals.com/).
I work on these challenges as time permits.
These challenges have so far made for an excellent way to learn some crypto implementation and brush up on languages I don't often use.
Kudos to the team which developed these challenge sets!
